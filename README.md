# The Hall of Stats

An alternate Hall of Fame populated by a mathematical formula.

Created by Adam Darowski, Jeffrey Chupp, and Michael Berkowitz.

**They say, “It’s the Hall of Fame, not the Hall of Stats.”**

But what if it was?

The Hall of Stats removes everyone from the Hall of Fame and re-populates it based on a mathematical formula.

You decide which Hall is better…

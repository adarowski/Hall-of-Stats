        My Interview on the MLB Network
        %span
          I was interviewed by Brian Kenny for his show <em>MLB Now</em> on the MLB Network. We talked about the Hall of Stats and the Hall of Fame’s anti-recency bias.

        The Standards of Today Would Create a Very Different Hall of Fame

          %strong For <em>The Hardball Times</em> —
          This is the article that inspired Brian Kenny to get me on the line. It explores how the Hall of Fame standards are higher for modern players. It was nominated for a SABR Research Award.

        The Hall of Fame Case for Jack Glasscock
        %span
          Deacon White is a Hall of Famer and Bill Dahlen is getting close. This is my case to remember Jack Glasscock, another 19th century star who deserves enshrinement.

        The Hall of Fame Case for Larry Walker
        %span
          Larry Walker has failed to gain induction to the Hall of Fame because he played 597 games (30% of his career) in Coors Field. That’s not right.

        The Hall of Fame Case for Scott Rolen
        %span
          After seeing Kenny Lofton fail to reach 5% on the BBWAA ballot, I’m afraid Scott Rolen will suffer the same fate. This is an exploration into what made him a 70-WAR player.

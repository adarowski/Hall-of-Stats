%article#consensus-body.long-form
  %p The Hall of Consensus is a living document that shows which players are supported by many sources for the Hall of Fame. These sources include the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the Hall of Stats, Baseball Think Factory’s Hall of Merit, and various Personal Halls of Fame.

  %p I’ve included the Personal Halls of:
  
  %ul
    %li <a href="/articles/personal-hall-6-here-it-is">Adam Darowski</a> (my own, published at this site)
    %li <a href="http://www.replacementlevelpodcast.com/2013/07/06/rethinking-the-hall-of-fame-part-one-position-players-2/">Ross Carey</a> (of the Replacement Level Podcast)
    %li <a href="http://replacementlevel.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/my-personal-hall-of-fame/">Bryan O’Connor</a> (of the Replacement Level Blog)

    %li <a href="http://left-field.blogspot.com/2013/07/personal-hall-of-fame-part-1-19th.html">Dan McCloskey</a> (of Left Field)

  %p Note that these are inductees of their respective Halls with the <em>player</em> designation (where applicable).

    %h3#blunders The Hall’s Biggest Blunders?
    %p
      These two lists are the most important. First, we have the players who are <strong>in</strong> the Hall of Fame, but <strong>excluded</strong> from the Hall of Stats, Hall of Merit, and everyone’s Personal Halls.
      The second list contains the opposite—the players the Hall of Fame has overlooked, but are honored by the Hall of Stats, Hall of Fame, and everyone’s Personal Halls.
    .column
      %h4 Only in the Hall of Fame:
      - if @only_hof.count > 0

    %h3 It’s About More than Just Stats
    %p
      The players who are <strong>only</strong> in the Hall of Stats had impressive statistical records, but seem to be missing the narrative that would garner them Hall of Fame support.
      The players in every Hall <em>except</em> the Hall of Stats didn’t quite reach the 100 Hall Rating, but have enough of a case to make up for it.

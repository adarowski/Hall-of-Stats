  %p The Hall of Consensus is a living document that shows which players are supported by many sources for the Hall of Fame. These sources include the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the Hall of Stats, Baseball Think Factory’s Hall of Merit, and various Personal Halls of Fame.

  %p I’ve included the Personal Halls of

  %p I will add more Personal Halls as fellow bloggers share them with me (no, not all of my friends consider themselves replacement level).

    %h3 The Hall’s Biggest Blunders
    %p
      These two lists are the most important. First, we have the players who are in the Hall of Fame, but excluded from the Hall of Stats, Hall of Merit, and everyone’s Personal Halls.
      The second list contains the players the Hall of Fame has overlooked, but are honored by the Hall of Stats, Hall of Fame, and everyone’s Personal Halls.
    .column
      %h4 Only in the Hall of Fame:
      - if @only_hof.count > 0
        %ol
          - @only_hof.each do |hoc_player|

    %h3 Only in the Alternate Halls
    %p
      The players who are only in the Hall of Stats had impressive statistical records, but seem to be missing the narrative that would give them Hall of Fame support.
      The players who are only in the Hall of Merit only come from the 19th century. I would consider most of these players as pioneers, but not strictly as players. As the Hall of Merit does not make such a distinction, I’m not quite sure how to classify them.

  %p
    With <a href="/articles/changes-to-era-committees">the recent changes to the Hall of Fame’s Era Committees</a>, it can be difficult to know who is eligible for the Hall of Fame and when. I’ll do my best to clarify things for you. Please note that when a player played in multiple Eras, we’re grouping him in the Era in which he produced the highest Hall Rating. The red and green icons indidate whether or not the player is in the Hall of Stats (HOS), Hall of Merit (HOM), or my Personal Hall of Fame (AD).

  %h3 2017

  %p In 2017, fifteen players will return from the 2016 BBWAA ballot. The Today’s Game Era Committee will also meet for the first time, but <a href="/articles/eligible-for-todays-game-era-ballot">they won’t have a huge pool of players</a> to choose from.

  %p 2018 features an impressive new crop of BBWAA candidates. It also will be the first time the new Modern Baseball Era Committee meets. They’ll have their work cut out for them. The pool of players to choose from is <em>stacked</em>.

  %h3 2020 

  %p Derek Jeter seems likely to headline the class of 2020. The Modern Baseball Era Committee will again meet. If Tim Raines fails to gain induction via the BBWAA in 2017, this will be his next chance.

  %h3 2021

  %p While it may be a relatively weak group of newcomers to the BBWAA ballot, two Era Committees actually meet in 2021. It will be the first meeting for the Golden Days Era Committee (which features a relatively thin pool of qualified players) and the Early Baseball Era Committee (which still has a surprisingly deep pool).

  %p We don’t yet know who the new BBWAA candidates in 2022 will be because they’re still active in 2016. But we do know the Today’s Game Era Committee will meet again and they’ll have many new strong candidates—particularly if Jeff Bagwell, Larry Walker, Edgar Martinez, and Fred McGriff miss BBWAA induction.

  %h3 2026

  %p The Golden Days Era Committee will meet again, but the Early Baseball Era Committee will not (it meets once every ten years). There will be no new candidates.

  %h3 2027

  %p In this election cycle, the Today’s Game Era Committee will be able to consider players that are actually hitting the BBWAA ballot for the first time in 2017, which means we have now come full circle.

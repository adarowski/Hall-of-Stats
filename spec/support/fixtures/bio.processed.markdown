Thurman Munson is a rarity—a Yankee who is underrated by the baseball
world at large. Munson’s life tragically ended when a small plane he was
piloting crashed in August of 1979. While Munson was entering the
decline phase of his career at the time of the accident, he was still a
league-average hitting catcher (with strong on-base skills but
diminished power) with above-average defense. That was and will always
be a valuable commodity.

Munson is a borderline Hall of Fame candidate simply based on the value
he provided before he died. If you give him any additional credit for
what might have been, he becomes a sure thing. When a player was
tragically taken from us before his career was over and he still
provided enough value to justify induction, he becomes an easy choice
for me.

In this sense, Munson is similar to [Sandy Koufax](/player/koufasa01 "View Sandy Koufax's page"). Koufax’s
numbers alone make him borderline Hall-worthy. But the fact that he got
to that level during an abbreviated career makes his case that much
better. Munson objectively has a Hall Rating of 101, but subjectively it
could be much higher.

What heights could Munson have reached if not for the accident? Munson
was an elite catcher from ages 23 to 30. In his age 31 and 32 seasons,
he had slumped to simply above-average. It was during his age 32 season
that his life was cut short. Munson played during a golden era of
catchers—another reason he is underrated. How much value did Munson’s
elite peers provide after their age 32 seasons?

Tigers catcher [Bill Freehan](/player/freehbi01 "View Bill Freehan's page") is one of the best comparisons
for Munson. Freehan’s last season as a top catcher, coincidentally, was
his age 32 season. He was an average catcher one year after that and
below average in his final season (at age 34). [Ted Simmons](/player/simmote01 "View Ted Simmons' page")
was a very valuable catcher in his age 33 season. But after that, he
fell apart. He hung on for five more seasons, but likely hurt his Hall
of Fame case more than he helped. [Gene Tenace](/player/tenacge01 "View Gene Tenace's page") was also
very valuable at age 33. Despite playing sparingly in St. Louis during
his age 34 and 35 seasons, Tenace was brilliant (his on-base skills were
severely underrated). He was below average at age 36, but in a small
sample size (78 plate appearances).

Not one of those three catchers made it into the Hall of Fame. Three of
Munson’s peers did, however. Among those, [Carlton Fisk](/player/fiskca01 "View Carlton Fisk's page") was
a freak, adding 26.5 WAR after his age 32 season (peaking at 4.7 WAR at
age 42). [Johnny Bench](/player/benchjo01 "View Johnny Bench's page"), interestingly, was more or less
done at age 32. He provided just 1.9 WAR over three abbreviated seasons
after that. [Gary Carter](/player/cartega01 "View Gary Carter's page") was also finished as an
above-average starter, but did hang on for six seasons and provide some
value above replacement.

Given his talent level at age 32, it’s not a stretch to say Munson had
another good season or two in him. If he had a couple more partial
seasons after that, then 2000 hits would have been easily attainable. 50
WAR would not have been a stretch. Add in his 1976 MVP Award, seven All
Star nods, a Rookie of the Year Award, three Gold Gloves, two World
Series rings, and a .373/.417/.493 line in the World Series, and you
would have yourself a pretty easy Hall of Famer.

Instead, Munson is The Great Underrated Yankee.

      <title>Thurman Munson: The Great Underrated Yankee</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/thumbs/munsoth01.jpg" alt="Thurman Munson"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/player/munsoth01" title="View Thurman Munson&amp;#39;s page"&gt;Thurman Munson&lt;/a&gt;’s life tragically ended when a small plane he was piloting crashed in August of 1979. Munson may have been entering the decline phase of his career at the time of the accident, but he was still a league-average hitting catcher (with strong on-base skills but diminished power) with above-average defense. That was and will always be a valuable commodity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munson is a borderline Hall of Fame candidate based purely on the value he provided before his death. If you give him any additional credit for what might have been, he becomes an easier choice. In this sense, Munson is similar to &lt;a href="/player/koufasa01" title="View Sandy Koufax&amp;#39;s page"&gt;Sandy Koufax&lt;/a&gt;. Koufax’s numbers alone make him borderline Hall-worthy. But the fact that he achieved that level during an abbreviated career makes his case that much better. Munson objectively has a Hall Rating of 101, but subjectively he is much more deserving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What heights could Munson have reached if not for the accident? Munson was an elite catcher from ages 23 to 30. In his age 31 and 32 seasons, he had slumped to simply above-average. It was during his age 32 season that his life was cut short. One other reason Munson is underrated is that he played during a golden era of catchers. How much value did Munson’s elite peers provide after their age 32 seasons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tigers catcher &lt;a href="http://yahoo.com/player/freehbi01" title="View Bill Freehan&amp;#39;s page"&gt;Bill Freehan&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best comparisons for Munson. Freehan’s last season as a top catcher, coincidentally, was his age 32 season. He was an average catcher one year after that and below average in his final season (at age 34). &lt;a href="/player/simmote01" title="View Ted Simmons&amp;#39; page"&gt;Ted Simmons&lt;/a&gt; was a very valuable catcher in his age 33 season. But after that, he fell apart. He hung on for five more seasons, but likely hurt his Hall of Fame case more than he helped. &lt;a href="/player/tenacge01" title="View Gene Tenace&amp;#39;s page"&gt;Gene Tenace&lt;/a&gt; was also
very valuable at age 33. Despite playing sparingly in St. Louis during his age 34 and 35 seasons, Tenace was brilliant (his on-base skills were severely underrated). He was below average at age 36, but in a small sample size (78 plate appearances).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not one of those three catchers made it into the Hall of Fame (though Simmons and Tenace join Munson in the Hall of Stats). Three of Munson’s peers were inducted, however. Among those, &lt;a href="/player/fiskca01" title="View Carlton Fisk&amp;#39;s page"&gt;Carlton Fisk&lt;/a&gt; was a freak, adding 26.5 WAR after his age 32 season (peaking at 4.7 WAR at age 42). &lt;a href="/player/benchjo01" title="View Johnny Bench&amp;#39;s page"&gt;Johnny Bench&lt;/a&gt;, interestingly, was more or less done at age 32. He provided just 1.9 WAR over three abbreviated seasons after that. &lt;a href="/player/cartega01" title="View Gary Carter&amp;#39;s page"&gt;Gary Carter&lt;/a&gt; was also finished as an above-average starter, but did hang on for six seasons and provide some value above replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given his talent level at age 32, it’s not a stretch to say Munson had another good season or two in him. If he had a couple more partial seasons after that, then 2000 hits would have been easily attainable. 50 WAR would not have been a stretch. Add in his 1976 MVP Award, seven All Star nods, a Rookie of the Year Award, three Gold Gloves, two World Series rings, and a .373/.417/.493 line in the World Series, and you would have yourself a pretty easy Hall of Famer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://google.com/wait-what/haha.jpg"&gt;Instead, Munson is The Great Underrated Yankee.&lt;/p&gt;
